*** Project Overview ***
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. 
The model recognizes different traffic signs, contributing to autonomous driving technology and traffic safety systems.

** Features **
1. Traffic sign classification using deep learning
2. Data augmentation to improve model performance
3. Achieves high accuracy on the GTSRB dataset

** Installation **
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repo_url>
2. Install dependencies: pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
3. Download the GTSRB dataset (https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) 

** Usage **
1. Preprocess the data by running: python preprocess.py
2. Train the CNN model: python train.py
3. Test the model: python test.py

** Results **
The model achieves a classification accuracy of over 99% on the GTSRB dataset.
